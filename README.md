# Schema for XML Catalogs

XML Catalogs are defined by an [OASIS technical committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=entity), which provides [a technical specification](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/14809/xml-catalogs.html).

Artifacts downlaoded from OASIS:

- `catalog.dtd`
- `catalog.rng`
- `catalog.xsd`

In addition, there's a Schematron:

- `xml-catalog.sch`: Raw Schematron
- `xml-catalog.sch.xsl`: Schematron compiled to XSLT

And an XML Catalog bringing things together:

- `xml-catalog.xml`
